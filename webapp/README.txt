README for Mapyst Webapp

This folder contains the frontend code for the Mapyt webapp. It receives information about CMU's campus, blueprints of the buildings' floors, and route directions around campus from a web api. The frontend displays the popular locations on campus, allows the user to search or get directions based on their preferences, displays a route over google maps, and allows the user to print out the directions.

The javascript code is compiled using Google's Closure Compiler which can be downloaded at https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/. To compile either modify (the path to the compiler jar) and run the batch file in the js folder or follow Google's Closure Compiler instructions to compile the same files compiled in the batch file.
